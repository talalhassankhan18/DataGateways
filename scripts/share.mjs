/**
 * Puts the local dev server on a public URL, so someone on a different network can look at it.
 *
 * This opens a Cloudflare "quick tunnel": an outbound connection from this machine to Cloudflare,
 * which hands back a throwaway https://<random>.trycloudflare.com address and forwards requests
 * back down it. No account, no router configuration, nothing listening on your public IP.
 *
 *   npm run share            # tunnels http://localhost:3000
 *   npm run share -- 4173    # tunnels some other port
 *
 * Read this before you send the link to anyone:
 *
 *   - The URL is PUBLIC and UNAUTHENTICATED. It is unguessable, not private. Anyone who has it,
 *     or who is forwarded it, can open the site.
 *   - It lives only while this command runs. Ctrl-C, sleep the machine or drop the Wi-Fi and the
 *     link dies. A new run gives a different address.
 *   - Whoever opens it is reading YOUR dev server — current working state, source maps and all.
 *   - The site still carries unconfirmed compliance marks and an invented partner directory.
 *     See docs/PRE-LAUNCH-SIGNOFF.md. Fine for a named reviewer; not fine somewhere indexable.
 *
 * For a review, `npm run build && npm run preview` first and share that instead: it is the bundle
 * that would actually ship, it loads faster over a tunnel, and it has no HMR socket to fail.
